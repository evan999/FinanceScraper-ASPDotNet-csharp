Meeting - 7/10/19

Project has been ported over to ASP.NET.
Through research, it has been determined that for the remaining duration
of the project that an ASP.NET app is required to fulfill the requirements 
of Phase 2 and onward. An MVC is required to connect the database to the scraper
to import the data into the database.

Project is currently BEHIND SCHEDULE.

Phase 2 Deadline: 7/15/19

Problems encountered:

Needed to switch over from console application to ASP.NET application.
Too much time was spent to research and decide an approach to this, and it's
been difficult to reach out to coworkers during the break.
However, support has been received, and it has been determined that the project
will be moved over to the ASP.NET app for the remaining duration. 

While deadline will be tight, the good news is that some of the work for Phase 3
has been laid out with the switch over to an ASP.NET app. Therefore, less work may
need to be done to complete the front-end for phase 3.

Today's item:

Port over scraper code to ASP.NET application. Research ASP.NET 
and develop an understanding of the infrastructure of an ASP.NET application.

Plan moving forward:

-Import data scraped into table fields.
